[arXiv:2412.08766 [astro-ph.CO]](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.08766)

This repository contains the code and data used for the research presented in the paper:  
**"What Do We Learn by Mapping Dark Energy to a Single Value of $w$?"**

## Repository Structure

### Main Directory
- **`main.py`**:  
  - Generates all the data required for the study.  
  - Saves the generated data in `.txt` files.  
  - Creates and plots the figures used in the paper.  

- **`figure-create.py`**:  
  - Generates plots based on the data stored in `.txt` files.  

### Figures and Data Directory (`figures_and_data`)
- Contains all the data used to generate the plots.  
- Includes the figures used in the paper.  

## How to Use
1. Run `main.py` to generate the data and figures. The output data will be saved in `.txt` files within the `figures_and_data` directory.  
2. Use `figure-create.py` to generate plots directly from the saved `.txt` data.
